# Inventory Management Dashboard 📊  

## Overview  
This project is an **Inventory Management Dashboard** designed to track, analyze, and optimize inventory data. The data is extracted from an **SQL Server database** using **ODBC32** on a local machine. The dashboard provides a detailed view of inventory transactions, stock levels, and key performance metrics.

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL Server** – Data storage and retrieval  
- **ODBC32** – Connection to the SQL Server database  
- **Python (Pandas, pyodbc)** – Data extraction and processing  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and reporting  

## Features  
### 🔹 Data Extraction & Integration  
- Connects to **SQL Server** using **ODBC32**  
- Retrieves inventory data and ensures data consistency  
- Prepares clean datasets for visualization  

### 🔹 Dashboard Insights  
1. **Stock Overview** 📦  
   - Displays current inventory levels per category  
   - Identifies low-stock items for restocking  
   
2. **Transactions History** 🔄  
   - Tracks inventory movements (inbound & outbound)  
   - Filters by **date, product, and category**  

3. **Supplier & Purchase Analysis** 🏭  
   - Evaluates supplier efficiency and delivery timelines  
   - Tracks purchase orders and associated costs  

4. **Sales & Demand Trends** 📈  
   - Analyzes sales volume over time  
   - Helps predict demand and optimize inventory levels  

5. **Alerts & Notifications** ⚠️  
   - Identifies critical stock shortages  
   - Highlights anomalies in inventory transactions  

## How to Use  
1. **Ensure ODBC32 is installed** and connected to SQL Server  
2. **Run the Python script** to extract and preprocess the data  
3. **Open the Power BI Dashboard** to visualize key insights  

## Future Enhancements 🚀  
- **Automate data refresh** for real-time updates  
- **Enhance predictive analytics** for stock forecasting  
- **Integrate with ERP systems** for seamless workflow
